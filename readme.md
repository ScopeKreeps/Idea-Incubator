#Idea Incubator
These are the project ideas of ScopeKreeps for the nReality Journeyman Program.

#1 Secure Notepad
The idea is to create an encrypted "Flat File Repository" that can be used to store sensitive notes, passwords etc.
* The main requirement is to have the authentication integrated with Windows Authentication so that the notepad would be easily available to a specific Windows Authenticated User.

#2 Build Monitor
The idea is to create a Red / Green build monitor integration.
* This is to notify a team when their build is broken .... and possibly also to publicly out a build breaker
* There were considerations regarding including hardware components to stimulate a development environment (i.e. Siren of Shame)

#3 Task List - Light Project Management Thingy
The idea is about replacing a lightweight Excel "Scrum" task tracking solution with a lightweight Web UI.

#4 Vehicle Tracking
The idea is to use an existing API on a fleet management platform to create a light vehicle tracking UI.

#5 Twitter Fines Application
The idea is to create an application that can be used to nominate people for Fines, to Track Fines nominations, and to allow Nominations to be voted on
* It was suggested that Twitter could be used as the backing "Data Store" and "Engine" for the Fines Application.

The Twitter Fines Application has been chosen for the ScopeKreeps Journeyman project. The rest of the story can be followed here [#Shame - for Tweeting Fines](../../../Shame).
